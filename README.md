Breaking down embedded systems concepts until I reach the essence 

# Project Aim
To explore a variety of embedded systems concepts with the intention of breaking down each concept to the fundamentals so each concept can truely be understood.
With each concept being recorded with detailed notes and code examples. Which hopefully should help build a solid repository of knowledge that can be used by me and anyone that happens to stumble across this.
